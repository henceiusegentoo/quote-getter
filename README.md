A website that shows quotes and the top 10 cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap using the coincap-API.

We use Spring Boot for the back end, Vite + React Ts for the front end and a sqlite db to store data.

If you want to work on this, open the frontend-folder in your ide for frontend-work and the backend-folder for backend work. It's not recommended to open the project root.

The recommended IDEs to use are Webstorm and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate by Jetbrains
